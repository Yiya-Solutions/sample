        A technology is anything made by humans to solve a problem or make life
        easier! Simple tools like cups, spoons, chairs, and slippers are all
        technologies! There are three categories of technology objects, systems, and
        processes. An object is a technology made of just one material, like a cup
        or spoon. A system has multiple pieces working together, like a notebook or
        bicycle. A process is a procedure for how to do something or how to make
        something. Cooking is a process technology!
